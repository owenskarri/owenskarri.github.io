<img src="meandosc.jpg" id="Oscpic"/>
<p>
Emerging talented multimedia designer enrolled at Eastern Washington University-Visual Communication Design program as a Post-Bachelor.  I received my first Bachelors at Washington State University in Apparel Merchandising & Textiles, minoring in Business Administration.  The past 15 years I have showed my entrepreneurial spirit by starting and managing my own businesses, Owens Quarter Horses and DesignsbyKarKar.
</p>
<p>
Owens Quarter Horses was in business for 10 years, where I bought and sold show horses on the AQHA Circuit.   As business owner and competitor I have acquired a tremendous understanding of the Pleasure Horse Industry  and parlaying those talents into an emerging equine marketing freelance business. Services I provided for the equine industry are photography, videos and equine ads for self promotion or sale. 
</p>

<p>
In 2010 I started DesignsbyKarKar, custom hat & applique business tailored to the equine industry.  My hats have been sold all over the world and are as unique as they come.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy collaborating with clients in achieving their desired goal in my design work. Services I provide are graphic design for print or web, video editing, web sites and photography. I am schedule to have my Bachelors of Arts in Visual Design 2017.
